	  <p>The client is a major player in office supplies worldwide. Their Innovation Lab is an internal department which focuses on increasing conversions across their online and offline properties through personalized offers to the buyer. By tracking the customer clickstream and comparing it with the standard buying patterns, the statistical modeling predicts the buying choices of the customer in real time. This data is then used to generate offers specific to the customer in a request response cycle (10ms SLA).</p>
	  <p>C42 Engineering worked with the client team to add features and enhance the platform. C42 was also involved in implementing an Extract-Transform-Load process to load the clickstream data from Hadoop (used for statistical modeling) into Amazon's Redshift. This was used to improve the quality of realtime reports on the performance of various experimental models run by the team.</p>

	  <p>Founded by a team of Indian media industry veterans and serial entrepreneurs with a track record of substantial exits, the client is a startup focused on disrupting digital media publishing.</p>
	  <p>Digital publishing is still in the dark ages, with the most commonly used platforms today being Wordpress and its cousins. The available solutions are over 10 years old, and are essentially a patchwork of blogging tools and plugins. The client is building the next generation of digital publishing platforms, one that addresses the needs of modern digital publishers and gives today's connected Internet users the means to consume and engage with content the way they want, where they want.</p>
	  <p>C42 was engaged by the client at the earliest stages of product inception and saw it through to launch. We have contributed to the architecture, development and deployment of the entire solution stack.</p>

	  <p>The client had recently proved product market fit and raised a round of financing. Their existing e-commerce system was an off-the-shelf CMS. It was simply not flexible enough to support the experimentation necessary to stay on a hockey-stick growth curve. Onboarding product types and running complex A/B tests to streamline funnels took far too much time and effort.</p>
	  <p>C42 Engineering first worked with the client to transition their engineering team from PHP to Rails, then helped architect and build the application that is currently handling millions of visits every month. We've worked with them through 100x growth and continue to work with them to help achieve the next 100x.</p>

They know how to make offshore development work well, and their communication skills are top-notch.  By the end of the first week, they were working at full-speed, building new features and executing on our infinitely long product roadmap.  It was easier to onboard C42 than it was to onboard any other developer we’ve worked with. After interviewing almost a dozen other firms, we ultimately decided to work with C42.</blockquote>

Not only does he ensure that the implementation closely matches the business needs, but he also thinks through the user flow and makes great recommendations to improve the overall experience. I've also interacted to a limited extent with the rest of the team, and their values strongly mirror what I’ve seen with Aakash. I trust C42 completely with my product.</blockquote>

	  <p>It is currently complicated and cumbersome to plan amazing international vacations. CleverBootz is going to change that. Their goal is to make the planning every bit as fun as the actual trip by re-thinking the process of international vacation planning as a fun, social experience.</p>
	  <p>CleverBootz approached us with 4 wireframes, a 2 page requirements document, a solid business plan and an amazing business team. It has been a roller coaster journey since then: while the overall goal was to deliver a prototype, things weren't that straightforward. The requirements changed a lot as we learned more about our users and the travel ecosystem on multiple continents. Using Rails and XP practices we were able to provide an environment where these changes could be accommodated really easily resulting in a prototype that was well received by customers on a tight schedule. We are continuing to work with CleverBootz as they build out their product.</p>
