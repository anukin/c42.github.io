      "The client is a major player in office supplies worldwide. Their Innovation Lab is an internal department which focuses on increasing conversions across their online and offline properties through personalized offers to the buyer. By tracking the customer clickstream and comparing it with the standard buying patterns, the statistical modeling predicts the buying choices of the customer in real time. This data is then used to generate offers specific to the customer in a request response cycle (10ms SLA).",
      "C42 Engineering worked with the client team to add features and enhance the platform. C42 was also involved in implementing an Extract-Transform-Load process to load the clickstream data from Hadoop (used for statistical modeling) into Amazon's Redshift. This was used to improve the quality of realtime reports on the performance of various experimental models run by the team."

      "CleverBootz approached us with 4 wireframes, a 2 page requirements document, a solid business plan and an amazing business team. It has been a roller coaster journey since then: while the overall goal was to deliver a prototype, things weren't that straightforward. The requirements changed a lot as we learned more about our users and the travel ecosystem on multiple continents. Using Rails and XP practices we were able to provide an environment where these changes could be accommodated really easily resulting in a prototype that was well received by customers on a tight schedule. We are continuing to work with CleverBootz as they build out their product."
